# Python-Arrays
A small python script that asks for numbers that will be added to an array, that will be sorted and the user can search for a number in the array.

## How To Use
Enter in any whole number followed by a return to add it to the array, the entered array will be sorted in ascending order.

The user can then choose if he/she wants to search for a number in the entered array
The program will respond with:
 * How many times the desired number exists in the array
 * What index(es) the number is located at in the sorted array
